/* Coding Challenge #2

1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h */

class CarlCl {
  constructor(make, speed) {
    this.make = make;
    this.speed = speed;
  }

  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 10;
    console.log(`${this.make} speed is ${this.speed}km/h`);
  }
  brake() {
    this.speed -= 5;
    console.log(`${this.make} speed is ${this.speed}km/h`);
  }

  get speedUS() {
    return console.log(`Speed in the US is ${this.speed / 1.6}mi/h`);
  }

  set speedUS(speed) {
    this.speed = speed * 1.6;
  }
}

const ferrari = new CarlCl("Ferrari", 100);
console.log(ferrari);

ferrari.accelerate();
ferrari.accelerate();
ferrari.brake();
ferrari.speedUS;
ferrari.speedUS = 71.875;
console.log(ferrari);
